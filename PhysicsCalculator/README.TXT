PROJECT TITLE: PhysicsCalculator
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To make physics hw faster
VERSION or DATE: 1.2, 8/21/17
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Finish adding any formulas I have listed in program but not implemented or add new ones
AUTHORS: Ryan Regier
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Don't waste your time trying to break my program. The program will break if you don't follow the instructions because I am not coding this to be a strong program but a barebones calculator that can get the job done.
